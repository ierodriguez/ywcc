            <h2>Data Analytics in Sports</h2>
            <p>Data plays a large role in almost every business, and the sports industry is no different. 
                The sports industry has continued to progress  over time, 
                with organizations becoming more and more receptive to using data to gain a competitive edge. 
                The worldwide sports market is one of the largest in the world, 
                and it’s expected to skyrocket to almost $500 in 2022.</p>
            <p>With increased spending, sports organizations are now provided with the opportunity to move away from traditional 
                ways of analyzing opponents. Instead of simply limiting research to studying how 
                teams play,  organizations are now able to invest in analytical data 
                that they can use to evaluate their competitors’ performance.</p>

            <h2>Why it's the Future</h2>
            <p>Analytical data in sports is useful for numerous ways. Primarily speaking, it provides teams with a better on field advantage, 
                it helps to prevent jury, and it improves customer engagement while bringing more money to the league.
            Almost all sports use data analytics to improve their on-field performance. 
                Baseball teams use analytics to determine defensive placement, basketball and football team  use analytics to decide which type of plays 
                are best to run. Soccer teams  use data analytics and  camera systems to track the 
                motions of every player on the field.</p>
            
            <p>In terms of data analytics and injury prevention, heart monitors track and collect information regarding each player’s 
                heart rate throughout their performances. Heart and brain health are two of the prevailing 
                areas where sports franchises use data analytics. In recent years, the NFL has heavily relied on data to prevent brain damage to its players.</p>
            <p>Sports organizations commonly use data to promote ticket sales, improve fan engagement, 
                and better understand their marketing efforts. For example, 
                marketing professionals may track how team apparel sales correspond with wins and then 
                adjust prices to maximize consumer interest and merchandise spending. In addition to this, business professionals may find opportunities for sales or special offerings.</p>
